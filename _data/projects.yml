- title: Abstract text summarization - Final sem thesis work
  event: Abstractive summarization is the technique of generating a summary of a text from its main ideas, not by copying verbatim most salient sentences from text. This is an important and challenging task in natural language processing. For my final year undergrad thesis, we worked on this topic. We took the aid of stacked CNNs to build our deep learning model in order to summarize research papers which were available on the internet. We achieved a accuracy of 87% which was pretty adequate

- title: Research paper documentation on NLP
  event: I wrote a journal on Natural Language Processing. I extracted Twitter data from a particular time period, the advent of Covid-19 and studied the sentiments of those extracted tweets using IBM Watson tone analyser, BERT model, mallet and TextBlob tools. We analysed the trends of positive andnegative tweets over time.

- title: Music recommendation system
  event: Using machine learning, I created a recommendation system similar to Spotify to study the users’ song preferences and recommend songs accordingly

- title: Convolutional neural network for biomedical image segmentation using hardware acceleration
  event: Using CNNs to process brain segmentation using hardware accelerations. The 3 edge detection algorithms were compared, Sobel, canny and Prewitt operators and then fed the output images produced to a GPU using CNN’s for biomedical image segmentation.

- title: Machine learning assessments of soil drying
  event: I used 2 prominent machine learning algorithms, Decision classifier and KNN algorithm to classify whether a particular soil type is wet or dry. For this, 3 parameters were considered in order to train the model; preciptation1, precipation2, and pot evaporation. These techniques are useful in order to determine the amount of water required for a particular type of soil.

- title: Research paper on protein -protein interaction between molecules
  event: I wrote a research paper which investigated the interactions between proteins. We used various data structure algorithms and found the relationship between the protein-protein interaction
