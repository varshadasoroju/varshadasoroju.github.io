- title: Research paper documentation on NLP
  event: I wrote a journal on Natural Language Processing. I extracted Twitter
data from a particular time period, the advent of Covid-19 and studied the sentiments of those extracted tweets using
IBM Watson tone analyser, BERT model, mallet and TextBlob tools. We analysed the trends of positive andnegative
tweets over time.

- title: Convolutional neural network for biomedical image segmentation using hardware acceleration
  event: Using
CNNs to process brain segmentation using hardware accelerations. The 3 edge detection algorithms were compared,
Sobel, canny and Prewitt operators and then fed the output images produced to a GPU using CNN’s for biomedical
image segmentation.
